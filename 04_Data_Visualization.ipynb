    "## Choosing a Data Visualization Package <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"Choosing_Package\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many excellent data visualiation modules available in Python, but for the tutorial we will stick to the tried and true combination of **matplotlib** and **seaborn**. You can read more about different options for data visualization in Python in the [More Resources](#More-Resources:) section at the bottom of this notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Matplotlib\n",
    "**matplotlib** is very expressive, meaning it has functionality that can easily account for fine-tuned graph creation and adjustment. However, this also means that **matplotlib** is somewhat more complex to code. The basic steps to create graphs with this package are:\n",
    "1. Prepare your data\n",
    "2. Create the plot\n",
    "3. Plot the plot\n",
    "4. Customize plot\n",
    "5. Save and show plot\n",
    "\n",
    "More info can be found here:https://matplotlib.org/users/beginner.html\n",
    "\n",
    "### Seaborn\n",
    "**seaborn** is a higher-level visualization module, which means it is much less expressive and flexible than matplotlib, but far more concise and easier to code. In addition to matlab, this package makes it easier to\n",
    "1. Use default themes that are aesthetically pleasing\n",
    "2. Set custom color palettes\n",
    "3. Make attractive statistical plots\n",
    "4. Easily and flexibly displaying distributions\n",
    "5. Visualize information from matrices and DataFrames\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see it as a complement, not a substitute, for Matplotlib. There are some tweaks that still require Matplotlib.\n",
    "More info can be found here: http://seaborn.pydata.org/api.html#api-ref\n",
    "\n",
    "It may seem like we need to choose between these two approaches, but this is not the case! Since `seaborn` is itself written in **matplotlib** (you will sometimes see **seaborn** be called a **matplotlib** 'wrapper'), we can use **seaborn** for making graphs quickly and then **matplotlib** for specific adjustments. When you see `plt` referenced in the code below, we are using **matplotlib's** pyplot submodule.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**seaborn** also improves on **matplotlib** in important ways, such as the ability to more easily visualize regression model results, creating small multiples, enabling better color palettes, and improve default aesthetics. From [**seaborn**'s documentation](https://seaborn.pydata.org/introduction.html):\n",

    "\n",
    "The title of a visualization occupies the most valuable real estate on the page. If nothing else, you can be reasonably sure a viewer will at least read the title and glance at your visualization. This is why you want to put thought into making a clear and effective title that acts as a **narrative** for your chart highlighting the **Important takeaway** of the figure. Many novice visualizers default to an **explanatory** title, something like: \"Average Projects over Time (2012-2021)\". This title is correct - it just isn't very useful. This is particularly true since any good graph will have explained what the visualization is through the axes and legends. Instead, use the title to reinforce and explain the core point of the visualization. It should answer the question \"Why is this graph important?\" and focus the viewer onto the most critical take-away.\n",

    "### A Note on Data Sourcing\n",
    "\n",
    "Data sourcing is a critical aspect of any data visualization. Although here we are simply referencing the agencies that created the data, it is ideal to provide as direct of a path as possible for the viewer to find the data the graph is based on. When this is not possible (e.g. the data is sequestered), directing the viewer to documentation or methodology for the data is a good alternative. Regardless, providing clear sourcing for the underlying data is an **absolutely requirement** of any respectable visualization, and further builds trusts and enables reproducibility.\n",
